You will note that I used vanilla-javascript instead of typescript. This is just for speed - I have been on typescript projects before and it wouldn't take me long to get used to it again, but I have been writing vanilla-js react for the last couple of years.


Possible Future Enhancements
 - refactor hawkTable/row/header into generic components taking in a column config so that the table can be reused across the application, no matter what model/API is used
 - infinite scroll
